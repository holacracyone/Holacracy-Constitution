# Introduction: Holacracy® Constitution

### What is this document?

This Constitution documents the core rules, structure, and processes of the Holacracy “operating system” for governing and managing an organization. It provides a critical foundation for an organization wishing to use Holacracy, by anchoring the shift of power required in concrete and documented “rules of the game”, which everyone involved can reference and rely upon.

### How is this document intended to be used?
This Constitution is intended to be referenced by whatever declaration or agreement captures the decision to organize using the Holacracy system. That may be a formal set of legal bylaws or similar operating agreement, or a simple board resolution or CEO policy declaration similar to the <a href="https://github.com/holacracyone/Holacracy-Constitution/blob/master/Adoption%20Declaration%20Sample.pdf" target="_blank">sample one attached here</a>. See Article V for key adoption-related matters, and note also that this explanatory page and the sample declaration are included for informative purposes but do not constitute part of the core Constitution document.

### What this document isn’t
This document is not a complete set of legal bylaws or a formal operating agreement, although HolacracyOne separately publishes its own operating agreement as an example of a legal governing document that references and incorporates this Constitution. Nor is this document for learning to actually use the Holacracy system – like the rulebook for a nuanced sport, it can serve as a critical reference at times, but reading it will not teach you how to play the game.
